        description: 'Detection of high-risk work processes is crucial in preventing occupational diseases associated with prolonged one-sided strain on limbs. This thesis examines the current methodology of measuring workers to detect such processes using electromyography, from which exerted force is calculated. This force, in relation to a number of movements, is used in determining hygienic limits. Then, it proposes a new semi-automated method for detecting movement cycles, which is validated using experimental data.'
