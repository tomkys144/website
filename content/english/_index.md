Hi, my name is Tomas, in scout world known as Kyslík. Currently I am a student of Medical electronics and bioinformatics at [Faculty of Electrical Engineering,Czech Technical University](https://fel.cvut.cz).

I enjoy hardware development and embedded programming. Currently one of my big passions is smart-home, mainly using open-source hardware and software. Sometimes I talk about this passion in my hackerspace [Pátek](https://patekvpatek.cz)

Finally it is my honor to say, that I was elected deputy scout group leader for my scout group in Stará Boleslav, Czechia. In this group I am also leader of rovers and rangers, so I spend a lot of my free time with scouts.
